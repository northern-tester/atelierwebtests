			abstract : "Serena will introduce you to Docker as a technology, what a container is, how they relate to images and their json configuration. With examples of how they use source control concepts with push and pull commands, to enable the creation of test environments on a per model basis, in order to test not only the code, but that it is an operational entity which can stand alone when deployed. Key takeaways are how Docker can be useful for testers and the benefits of using Docker to create disposable test environments",
			bio : "Serena is a Test Engineer at Skybet within the Data Tribe, just getting started after finishing the software academy. Interested in all things testing, big data and technology in general. Has never been known to refuse free beer, and is unlikely to start now.",
